<h3>Opening Prayer - Creation</h3>
<div class="title">
  Canticle of the Creatures</div><i>St. Francis of Assisi </i><br>
<p><pre style="background-color:#FF6600";  ><b style="color:white";>All praise be yours, My Lord, through all that you have made.
And first my lord Brother Sun, who brings the day....
How beautiful is he, how radiant in all his splendour!
Of you, Most High, he bears the likeness.
All praise be yours, my Lord, through Sister Moon and Stars;
In the heavens you have made them, bright and precious and fair.
All praise be yours, my Lord, through Brothers Wind and Air....
All praise be yours, my Lord, through Sister Water, so useful, lowly,
precious and pure.
All praise be yours, my Lord, through Brother Fire,
through whom you brighten up the night....
All praise be yours, my Lord, through Sister Earth, our mother,
Who feeds us...and produces various fruits with coloured
flowers and herbs.... Praise and bless my Lord, and give him thanks,
And serve him with great humility.
